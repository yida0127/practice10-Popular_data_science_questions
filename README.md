# Guided Project-Popular Data Science Questions

In this course, we explored the business context in which data science happens. We'll now have a chance to apply 
what we've learned in a more relaxed way. Feel free to explore alternatives to the path we're taking in this project.

In this scenario, we're working for a company that creates data science content, be it books, online articles, videos or 
interactive text-based platforms like Dataquest.

We're tasked with figuring out what is best content to write about. Because we took this course, we know that given 
the lack of instructions there's some leeway in what "best" means here.

Since we're passionate about helping people learn, we decide to scower the internet in search for the answer to 
the question "What is it that people want to learn about in data science?" 
(as opposed to determining the most profitable content, for instance).

Thinking back to our experience when we first started learning programming, it occurs to us that if we wanted to figure out 
what programming content to write, we could consult [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (a question and answer website about programming) and see 
what kind of content is more popular.

We decide to investigate Stack Overflow a little more and find out that it is part of a question and answer website network called [Stack Exchange]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange.

![stackexchange](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/469/se-logo.png)

Stack Exchange hosts sites on a multitude of fields and subjects, including mathematics, physics, philosophy, and [data science](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/)! 
Here's a sample of the most popular sites:

Stack Exchange employs a reputation award system for its questions and answers. Each post — each question/answer — 
is a post that is subject to upvotes and downvotes. This ensures that good posts are easily identifiable.

Being a multidisciplinary field, there a few Stack Exchange websites there are relevant to our goal here:

- [Data Science](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/)
- [Cross Validated — a statistics site](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)
- [Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.stackexchange.com/)
- [Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

And if we want to include Data Engineering, we can also consider:

- [Database Administrators](https://dba.stackexchange.com/);
- [Unix & Linux](https://unix.stackexchange.com/);
- [Software Engineering](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/);

If we open the link in the image shared above, we'll find a complete list of Stack Exchange websites sorted by 
percentage of questions that received answers. At the time of this writing, [Data Science Stack Exchange (DSSE)](( https://data.stackexchange.com/datascience/query/edit/1245744)) 
is on the bottom 10 sites with respect to this metric.

The fact that DSSE is a data science dedicated site (contrarily to the others), coupled with it having a lot of 
an unanswered questions, makes it an ideal candidate for this investigation. DSSE will be the focus of this guided project.
